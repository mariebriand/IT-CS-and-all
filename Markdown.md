# Markdown #

> Markdown (.md) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and
Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.
Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
